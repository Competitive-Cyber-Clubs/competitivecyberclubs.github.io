title: Competition Map Update
---

Hello Visitors,

There has been some updates to the competition map in a new effort to get it up and running. Currently you can add your schools competition by editing the clubs.json file directly. Current goals are to move this site off of static site generator + add layers/search functionality to the competitions map. As always, looking for others help in contributing to this site. Thank you!
