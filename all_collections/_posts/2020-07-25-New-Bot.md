title: New Bot
---

As our discord server was growing, the moderation team found growing pains in how schools were created for new schools. Previously, it was done such as a new user would reach out and request a new school and then someone from the moderation team would have go and create that role and make it so it was allowed to be used by carl-bot for self assignment. This caused delays. I set about creating a custom Discord bot that would suite our needs. This bot took about 6 months to develope with the first commit one Dec 8th, 2019 and the first production release was on May 5th 2020. The bot is currently hosted on Heroku with a staging and production app. It is roughly 1.7k lines of python and used a database and an external CSV file to make it run smoothy. I am very happy with how it turned out and I got to learn more about async and databases while creating this bot.

If you wish to check it out, the source code is available on our [Github](https://github.com/Competitive-Cyber-Clubs/Discord-Bot) and feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
